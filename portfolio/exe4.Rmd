## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

df = as.matrix(AirPassengers)

#dim(as.matrix(df))

#summary(df)

#head(df, 10)

pass = c(0)
pass2 = c(0)

for(i in 1:length(df)){

  pass[i] = sum(df[1:i])
  
}


j=1
for(row in df){
  
  pass2[j]=sum(df[1:j])
  j=j+1
}
pass
pass2

```
